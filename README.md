# Pathfinding-Visualization

> A small python app to help visualize pathfinding algorithms.

## How to use 
1. Full support for the A* Pathfinding algorithm
2. Draw and erase walls for the algorithm to avoid using your mouse buttons
3. Press space to calculate route!

## Roadmap 
1. User-changeable start and end positions
2. Add support for Dijkstra's algorithm
